		<h4 class="policy__header">Description of our Services</h4>
		<p class="policy__text">
			Live Musically is a website that allows people to hire musicians available to perform or teach. We create opportunities for our users to “live musically” by making live music and musicians accessible with the click of a button.  Our platform provides free and instant access to musicians where users can browse musician profiles to view rates, resumes, work samples, and reviews, directly communicate with musicians, and hire and pay with ease.
		</p>
		<p class="policy__text">
			For Registered Individual Musicians and Groups of Musicians (“Musicians”), our Services facilitate your connection and interaction with opportunities to perform or teach in your area. For Registered Employers (“Employers”), our Services facilitate your connection and interaction with Musicians in your area that you can hire to perform or teach.  We do this by allowing Employers to search for Musicians and browse Musicians’ profiles (together, “Browse”), which includes uploaded audio, video, photographs, professional experience and rate information, as well as schedule and pay for (together, “Hire”) Musicians to perform or teach. Employers can also create an opportunity posting for which Musicians can browse and apply (together, “Apply”).  Musicians’ applications are reviewed by the Employer who posts the opportunity. The Employer is under no obligation to Hire a Musician that submitted an application for an opportunity.
		</p>
		<p class="policy__text">
			Live Musically does not act as an agent, employer, or partner of Users and does not engage in the services of a Talent Agency. Live Musically simply acts as a platform allowing Users to connect and interact and the fee charged by Live Musically is for the use of the platform. Each transaction is subject to Live Musically’s applicable service charge and fees.

					Safety at job. Both the Employer and the Musician are responsible to maintaining a safe and lawful environment for all guests at the event.
				</li>
				<li>
					Limitation of liability. For any confirmed booking, the most a Employer or Musician can claim damages for is the total agreed upon booking amount.

				<li>
					Falsified jobs. Jobs falsified with the intent of inflating ratings, arranging payment outside of Live Musically for a job created through Live Musically, or for any reason whatsoever are strictly prohibited.

					Live Musically is not liable.

Live Musically accepts no liability for damages caused by Musician no-shows, late-shows, or cancellations. Furthermore, Live Musically assumes no liability in disputes between the Employer and the Musician of any sort.
				</li>
				<li>
					Violation of binding contract. If any of the terms agreed upon in the binding contract between the Employer and Musician are violated or inappropriate behavior has been displayed in the reasonable view and discretion of Live Musically, we reserve the right to suspend or close the account of the party involved without warning, with or without refund. Live Musically also reserves the right to disallow Musician payment for the performance.
				</li>
				<li>
					Dispute resolution.

					Going “Outside Live Musically.” In the event that Live Musically provides Employers the contact information of Musicians, Employers may call or email the musicians to work out details. During the course of these conversations, if a Employer decides to contract with a Musician outside of Live Musically, Live Musically releases all responsibility related to the Musician and the Event, and the Live Musically Employer-Musician Contract is not enforceable in any way.
